PROJECT NAME:
    Hangman Game using Tkinter

DESCRIPTION:

    This project is a digital version of the classic Hangman word guessing game,
    developed using Python and its Tkinter library for GUI creation.
    The objective is to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number
    of attempts. The interface includes a graphical representation of the hangman being
    drawn with each wrong guess, a display for the guessed word, input functionality for
    guessing letters, and messages that guide or inform the player. The game automatically
    resets upon winning or losing, allowing for continuous play.
