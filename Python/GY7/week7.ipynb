    "## COMMUNICATION METHOD\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's a protocol used for transmitting hypertext (structured text that uses logical links) over the internet. HTTP is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web, and it is a protocol used by a client and server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about HTTP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stateless:** Each command is executed independently, without any knowledge of the commands that came before it. This is important because it allows for speed and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Client-Server Model:** The client sends an HTTP request, and the server sends back an HTTP response. The client is always the initiator of requests; the server responds to these requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **HTTP Messages:** HTTP messages are how data is exchanged between a server and a client. There are two types of messages: requests sent by the client to trigger an action on the server, and responses, the answer from the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **HTTP Methods:** The HTTP standard provides several methods (sometimes referred to as 'verbs') that guide the interaction with resources in a server. The most common are GET (retrieve a resource), POST (send data to the server), PUT (update a resource), DELETE (remove a resource), and HEAD (similar to GET but retrieves only headers, not the body of the resource).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **HTTP Status Codes:** These are issued by a server in response to a client's request. They include: 1xx (informational), 2xx (success), 3xx (redirection), 4xx (client errors), and 5xx (server errors). For example, \"200\" means \"OK\", \"404\" means \"Not Found\", and \"500\" means \"Internal Server Error\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **HTTP Headers:** These carry information about the request or the response, or about the object sent in the message body. They define the operating parameters of an HTTP transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **HTTPS:** This is HTTP with encryption. The protocol uses SSL or TLS to provide end-to-end security. It's used to protect sensitive information like credit card numbers or login credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of an HTTP request and response:\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTTP Request:**\n",
    "\n",
    "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Host: www.example.com\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTTP Response:**\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n",
    "Date: Mon, 23 May 2005 22:38:34 GMT\n",
    "Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n",
    "Content-Length: 138\n",
    "Last-Modified: Wed, 08 Jan 2003 23:11:55 GMT\n",
    "Server: Apache/1.3.3.7 (Unix) (Red-Hat/Linux)\n",
    "ETag: \"3f80f-1b6-3e1cb03b\"\n",
    "Accept-Ranges: bytes\n",
    "Connection: close\n",
    "\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "  <title>An Example Page</title>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "  Hello World, this is a very simple HTML document.\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the client sends a GET request to the server asking for the 'index.html' file. The server responds with a 200 OK status, indicating that the request was successful, and returns the requested file."

    "Frontend and backend communicate with each other using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests and responses. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The frontend (client-side) makes an HTTP request to the backend (server-side). This request can be of various types like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. The request may also contain data (like form data or JSON data) if it's a POST or PUT request.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The backend receives this request, processes it (like reading from a database, writing to a database, or performing some calculations), and then sends back an HTTP response. This response contains the status of the request (like 200 for success, 404 for not found, etc.) and any data that needs to be sent back to the frontend.\n",
